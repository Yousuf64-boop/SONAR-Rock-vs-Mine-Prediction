# SONAR-Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction
This project implements a machine learning model to classify sonar signals as either rocks or mines. Using logistic regression, the model analyzes frequency patterns from sonar returns to distinguish between these two types of objects.

Dataset
Source: Sonar data collected from various objects

Size: 208 samples with 60 features each

Target Variable:

'R' for Rock

'M' for Mine

Class Distribution: 111 Mines vs 97 Rocks

Features
60 numerical features representing different frequency bands from sonar returns

Each feature is a continuous value between 0 and 1

Features are sequentially numbered from 0 to 59

Methodology
Data Loading & Exploration: Loaded and examined the dataset structure and characteristics

Data Preprocessing: Split data into training (90%) and testing (10%) sets with stratification

Model Training: Implemented Logistic Regression classifier

Model Evaluation: Assessed performance using accuracy metrics

Results
Training Accuracy: 83.42%

Testing Accuracy: 76.19%

Usage
The trained model can predict whether a sonar signal corresponds to a rock or mine based on 60 input features:

python
# Example prediction
input_data = (0.0323, 0.0101, 0.0298, 0.0564, 0.0760, ...) # 60 values
prediction = model.predict(input_data)

if prediction[0] == 'M':
    print("The object is a mine")
else:
    print("The object is a rock")
Requirements
Python 3.x

NumPy

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Files
Rock_vs_Mine_prediction.ipynb: Main Jupyter notebook containing the complete implementation

Future Improvements
Experiment with other classification algorithms (SVM, Random Forest, Neural Networks)

Implement feature selection to improve model performance

Add cross-validation for more robust evaluation

Develop a web interface for real-time predictions
